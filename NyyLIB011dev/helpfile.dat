The GUI for NyyLIB includes a sorted chat window in the top right corner, and a display of group members across the bottom, on the right hand side, or both.

Depending on class/level, you should have various buttons available to you across the bottom of the screen. Most should provide a message when selected.

The left side of the screen has a vertical showing equipment related buttons.

The group window is either all at the bottom, all at the right hand side, or split with casters at the bottom, hitters/warriors at the right hand side. 

In the bottom left corner a countdown timer will display when stunned. To the right of it is a display that shows the current size of the character logged in. At levels less then 50, level/experience shows at the top of the screen. The map window shows above or to the left of the chat window.

There are a number of buttons present for all classes. To change the status of a button, move the mouse pointer overtop of it and click with the left mouse button.
  Loot - Off, loot coins only, or loot everything
  Flee - Off - All flee related triggers are disabled
         On - If you attemp to flee and fail, flee will be sent again

<green>Using the ‘@set autoloot’ command.

<green>Usage:

<green>@set autoloot coins - loots coins only.
<green>@set autoloot all   - loots all items (including coins).
<green>@set autoloot off   - turns off autoloot.
